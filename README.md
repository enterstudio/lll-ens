# ens-in-lll

This project is an implementation of the Ethereum Name Service in LLL. `ens-registry`, `fifs-registrar`, `test-registrar`, and `public-resolver` are complete implementations of the current ENS spec. To see an optimized version of the ENS registry, head over to the [official ENS repository](https://github.com/ethereum/ens). The registry currently deployed on Ropsten and that will eventually be deployed on the main Ethereum network is the LLL implementation you see in that repository.

The hash registrar in the official repository is a more complex undertaking. I will be implementing an LLL version in the future.
